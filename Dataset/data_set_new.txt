10/12/1826, 20:46 - Socrates: I examined the poets, and I look on them as people whose talent overawes both themselves and others, people who present themselves as wise men and are taken as such, when they are nothing of the sort.From poets, I moved to artists. No one was more ignorant about the arts than I; no one was more convinced that artists possessed really beautiful secrets. However, I noticed that their condition was no better than that of the poets and that both of them have the same misconceptions. Because the most skillful among them excel in their specialty, they look upon themselves as the wisest of men. In my eyes, this presumption completely tarnished their knowledge. As a result, putting myself in the place of the oracle and asking myself what I would prefer to be — what I was or what they were, to know what they have learned or to know that I know nothing — I replied to myself and to the god: I wish to remain who I am.We do not know — neither the sophists, nor the orators, nor the artists, nor I— what the True, the Good, and the Beautiful are. But there is this difference between us: although these people know nothing, they all believe they know something; whereas, I, if I know nothing, at least have no doubts about it. As a result, all this superiority in wisdom which the oracle has attributed to me reduces itself to the single point that I am strongly convinced that I am ignorant of what I do not know.

And if philosophy appears a bad thing to you, turn every man from it, not only your sons; but if it appears to you such as I think it to be, take courage, pursue it, and practice it, as the saying is, 'both you and your house.
11/25/1870, 14:02 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
11/25/1870, 14:03 - Socrates: Beauty is a short-lived tyranny
07/19/1856, 12:13 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
07/19/1856, 12:14 - Socrates: Money and honour have no attraction for them; good men do not wish to be openly demanding payment for governing and so to get the name of hirelings, nor by secretly helping themselves out of the public revenues to get the name of thieves. And not being ambitious they do not care about honour. Wherefore necessity must be laid upon them, and they must be induced to serve from the fear of punishment. And this, as I imagine, is the reason why the forwardness to take office, instead of waiting to be compelled, has been deemed dishonourable. Now the worst part of the punishment is that he who refuses to rule is liable to be ruled by one who is worse than himself. And the fear of this, as I conceive, induces the good to take office, not because they would, but because they cannot help — not under the idea that they are going to have any benefit or enjoyment themselves, but as a necessity, and because they are not able to commit the task of ruling to any one who is better than themselves, or indeed as good. For there is reason to think that if a city were composed entirely of good men, then to avoid office would be as much an object of contention as to obtain office is at present…
05/03/1783, 11:57 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
05/03/1783, 11:58 - Socrates: The ancient Oracle said that I was the wisest of all the Greeks. It is because I alone, of all the Greeks, know that I know nothing.
11/22/1834, 09:30 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
11/22/1834, 09:31 - Socrates: Are you not ashamed of heaping up the greatest amount of money and honour and reputation, and caring so little about wisdom and truth and the greatest improvement of the soul? 
10/29/1795, 08:56 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
10/29/1795, 08:57 - Socrates: Be true to thine own self

05/10/1860, 13:13 - Socrates: Wealth does not bring about excellence, but excellence makes wealth and everything else good for men, both individually and collectively.
02/15/1810, 07:33 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
02/15/1810, 07:34 - Socrates: The more I know, the more I realize I know nothing.
11/05/1812, 19:02 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
11/05/1812, 19:03 - Socrates: I honor and love you: but why do you who are citizens of the great and mighty nation care so much about laying up the greatest amount of money and honor And reputation, and so little amount wisdom and truth and the greatest improvement of the soul? Re you not ashamed of these?... I do nothing but go about persuading you all, not to take thought for your persons and your properties, but first and chiefly to care about the greatest improvement of the soul. I tell you that virtue is not given by more, but that from virtue comes money and every other good of man. 
04/09/1774, 15:41 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
04/09/1774, 15:42 - Socrates: True knowledge exists in knowing that you know nothing.
07/19/1865, 04:40 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
07/19/1865, 04:41 - Socrates: It is a disgrace to grow old through sheer carelessness before seeing what manner of man you may become by developing your bodily strength and beauty to their highest limit.
11/09/1853, 13:37 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
11/09/1853, 13:38 - Socrates: An unconsidered life is not one worth living.

11/05/1798, 20:30 - Socrates: Now the hour to part has come. I go to die, you go to live. Which of us goes to the better lot is known to no one, except the god.
04/26/1792, 17:33 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
04/26/1792, 17:34 - Socrates: A system of morality which is based on relative emotional values is a mere illusion, a thoroughly vulgar conception which has nothing sound in it and nothing true.
05/15/1837, 17:00 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
05/15/1837, 17:01 - Socrates: As to marriage or celibacy, let a man take which course he will, he will be sure to repent.

07/12/1817, 08:16 - Socrates: Such as thy words are such will thine affections be esteemed and such as thine affections will be thy deeds and such as thy deeds will be thy life ...
04/24/1868, 07:30 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
04/24/1868, 07:31 - Socrates: And so they grow richer and richer, and the more they think of making a fortune the less they think of virtue; for when riches and virtue are placed together in the scales of the balance, the one always rises as the other falls.
02/12/1815, 16:28 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
02/12/1815, 16:29 - Socrates: Remember that there is nothing stable in human affairs; therefore avoid undue elation in prosperity, or undue depression in adversity.
12/08/1781, 23:56 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
12/08/1781, 23:57 - Socrates: I desire only to know the truth, and to live as well as I can... And, to the utmost of my power, I exhort all other men to do the same... I exhort you also to take part in the great combat, which is the combat of life, and greater than every other earthly conflict.
03/21/1792, 20:24 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
03/21/1792, 20:25 - Socrates: The unexamined life is not worth living
08/10/1867, 10:19 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
08/10/1867, 10:20 - Socrates: As for me, all I know is that I know nothing, for when I don't know what justice is, I'll hardly know whether it is a kind of virtue or not, or whether a person who has it is happy or unhappy.
07/11/1796, 08:51 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
07/11/1796, 08:52 - Socrates: I soon realized that poets do not compose their poems with knowledge, but by some inborn talent and by inspiration, like seers and prophets who also say many fine things without any understanding of what they say.
05/22/1852, 07:41 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
05/22/1852, 07:42 - Socrates: For the fear of death is indeed the pretense of wisdom, and not real wisdom, being a pretense of knowing the unknown; and no one know whether death, which men in their fear apprehend to be the greatest evil, may not be the greatest good. Is not this ignorance of a disgraceful sort, the ignorance which is the conceit that a man knows that he does not know? And in this respect only I believe myself to differ from men in general, and may perhaps claim to be wiser than they are: that whereas I know but little of the world below, I do not suppose that I know...
05/09/1864, 20:47 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
05/09/1864, 20:48 - Socrates: Mankind is made of two kinds of people: wise people who know they're fools, and fools who think they are wise.
05/22/1861, 12:44 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
05/22/1861, 12:45 - Socrates: I do believe that there are gods, and in a far higher sense than that in which any of my accusers believe in them.
02/17/1838, 07:14 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
02/17/1838, 07:15 - Socrates: The true champion of justice, if he intends to survive even for a short time, must necessarily confine himself to private life and leave politics alone.
10/07/1837, 23:57 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
10/07/1837, 23:58 - Socrates: Smart people learn from everything and everyone, average people from their experiences, stupid people already have all the answers.

04/24/1793, 00:04 - Socrates: Remember, no human condition is ever permanent. Then you will not be overjoyed in good fortune, nor too sorrowful in misfortune.
02/03/1859, 23:19 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
02/03/1859, 23:20 - Socrates: God would seem to indicate to us and not allow us to doubt that these beautiful poems are not human, or the work of man, but divine and the work of God; and that the poets are only the interpreters of the Gods...
07/21/1795, 04:35 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
07/21/1795, 04:36 - Socrates: I do nothing but go about persuading you all, old and young alike, not to take thought for your persons or your properties, but and chiefly to care about the greatest improvement of the soul. I tell you that virtue is not given by money, but that from virtue comes money and every other good of man...
12/19/1824, 11:56 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
12/19/1824, 11:57 - Socrates: Neither in war nor yet at law ought any man to use every way of escaping death. For often in battle there is no doubt that if a man will throw away his arms, and fall on his knees before his pursuers, he may escape death; and in other dangers there are other ways of escaping death, if a man is willing to say and do anything. The difficulty, my friends, is not in avoiding death, but in avoiding unrighteousness; for that runs faster than death.
10/16/1830, 13:34 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
10/16/1830, 13:35 - Socrates: No one knows whether death may not be the greatest of all blessings for a man, yet men fear it as if they knew it was the greatest of evils.
04/19/1870, 19:48 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
04/19/1870, 19:49 - Socrates: Wisdom is knowing you know nothing
03/14/1813, 03:23 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
03/14/1813, 03:24 - Socrates: I know nothing except the fact of my ignorance.
09/13/1802, 15:02 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
09/13/1802, 15:03 - Socrates: The law presumably says that it is finest to keep as quiet as possible in misfortunes and not be irritated, since the good and bad in such things aren't plain, nor does taking it hard get one anywhere, not are any of the human things worthy of great seriousness.... One must accept the fall of the dice and settle one's affairs accordingly-- in whatever way argument declares would be best. One must not behave like children who have stumbled and who hold on to the hurt place and spend their time in crying out; rather one must always habituate the soul to turn as quickly as possible to curing and setting aright what has fallen and is sick, doing away with lament by medicine.
05/12/1852, 09:52 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
05/12/1852, 09:53 - Socrates: All I know is that I know nothing.

07/03/1773, 13:54 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
07/03/1773, 13:55 - Socrates: Nobody is qualified to become a statesman who is entirely ignorant of the problem of wheat.
06/15/1799, 11:27 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
06/15/1799, 11:28 - Socrates: The secret of change is to focus all of your energy not on fighting the old, but on building the new.
06/19/1804, 04:26 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
06/19/1804, 04:27 - Socrates: A man who really fights for justice must lead a private, not a public, life if he is to survive for even a short time.
04/19/1867, 07:16 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
04/19/1867, 07:17 - Socrates: And a thing is not seen because it is visible, but	conversely, visible because it is seen; nor is a thing led because	it is in the state of being led, or carried because it is in the	state of being carried, but the converse of this. And now I think, Euthyphro, that my meaning will be intelligible; and my	meaning is, that any state of action or passion implies previous	action or passion. It does not become because it is becoming,	but it is in a state of becoming because it becomes; neither	does it suffer because it is in a state of suffering, but it is in a	state of suffering because it suffers. Do you not agree?
01/20/1860, 08:11 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
01/20/1860, 08:12 - Socrates: One thing only I know, and that is that I know nothing.
09/17/1791, 21:41 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
09/17/1791, 21:42 - Socrates: By far the greatest and most admirable form of wisdom is that needed to plan and beautify cities and human communities.
11/20/1838, 15:20 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
11/20/1838, 15:21 - Socrates: And the same things look bent and straight when seen in water and out of it, and also both concave and convex, due to the sight’s being mislead by the colors, and every sort of confusion of this kind is plainly in our soul. And, then, it is because they take advantage of this affection in our nature that shadow painting, and puppeteering, and many other tricks of the kind fall nothing short of wizardry.
07/30/1860, 04:45 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
07/30/1860, 04:46 - Socrates: It is not difficult to avoid death, gentlemen of the jury; it is much more difficult to avoid wickedness, for it runs faster than death.
10/30/1842, 20:33 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
10/30/1842, 20:34 - Socrates: Employ your time in improving yourself by other men's writings, so that you shall gain easily what others have labored hard for.
06/06/1829, 14:34 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
06/06/1829, 14:35 - Socrates: To fear death, gentlemen, is no other than to think oneself wise when one is not, to think one knows what one does not know.  No one knows whether death may not be the greatest of all blessings for a man, yet men fear it as if they knew that it is the greatest of evils.  And surely it is the most blameworthy ignorance to believe that one knows what one does not know.  It is perhaps on this point and in this respect, gentlemen, that I differ from the majority of men, and if I were to claim that I am wiser than anyone in anything, it would be in this, that, as I have no adequate knowledge of things in the underworld, so I do not think I have.  I do know, however, that it is wicked and shameful to do wrong, to disobey one's superior, be he god or man.  I shall never fear or avoid things of which I do not know, whether they may not be good rather than things that I know to be bad.
12/24/1806, 20:03 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
12/24/1806, 20:04 - Socrates: wealth does not bring goodness, but goodness brings wealth and every other blessing, both to the individual and to the state
12/28/1825, 16:18 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
12/28/1825, 16:19 - Socrates: Do you feel no compunction, Socrates, at having followed a line of action which puts you in danger of the death penalty?'I might fairly reply to him, 'You are mistaken, my friend, if you think that a man who is worth anything ought to spend his time weighing up the prospects of life and death. He has only one thing to consider in performing any action--that is, whether he is acting rightly or wrongly, like a good man or a bad one.
06/06/1843, 22:47 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
06/06/1843, 22:48 - Socrates: Worthless people live only to eat and drink; people of worth eat and drink only to live.
11/14/1834, 12:55 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
11/14/1834, 12:56 - Socrates: How can you wonder your travels do you no good, when you carry yourself around with you?
01/29/1855, 01:32 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
01/29/1855, 01:33 - Socrates: I don't know why I did it, I don't know why I enjoyed it, and I don't know why I'll do it again.

12/17/1793, 14:15 - Socrates: Everything is plainer when spoken than when unspoken.

02/23/1872, 21:26 - Socrates: The really important thing is not live, but to live well.

05/21/1802, 05:18 - Socrates: The answer I gave myself and the oracle was that it was to my advantage to be as I am.
07/18/1783, 16:08 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
07/18/1783, 16:09 - Socrates: Each individual can only do one thing well. He can't do lots of things. If he tries, he will be jack of all trades, and master of none.
03/10/1866, 15:58 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
03/10/1866, 15:59 - Socrates: For this fear of death is indeed the pretense of wisdom, and not real wisdom, being the appearance of knowing the unknown; since no one knows whether death, which they in their fear apprehend to be the greatest evil, may not be the greatest good. Is there not here conceit of knowledge, which is a disgraceful sort of ignorance? And this is the point in which, as I think, I am superior to men in general, and in which I might perhaps fancy myself wiser than other men, - that whereas I know but little of the world below, I do not suppose that I know: but I do know that injustice and disobedience to a better, whether God or man, is evil and dishonorable, and I will never fear or avoid a possible good rather than a certain evil.
05/11/1838, 17:22 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
05/11/1838, 17:23 - Socrates: What I do not know, I do not think I know.
10/27/1830, 21:55 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
10/27/1830, 21:56 - Socrates: To fear death, gentlemen, is no other then to think oneself wise when one is not, to think one knows what one does not know.
08/19/1829, 07:35 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
08/19/1829, 07:36 - Socrates: I thought that as I had failed in the contemplation of true existence, I ought to be careful that I did not lose the eye of my soul; as people may injure their bodily eye by observing and gazing on the sun during an eclipse, unless they take the precaution of looking at the image reflected in the water, or in some similar medium. ...I was afraid that my soul might be blinded altogether if I looked at things with my eyes or tried by the help of my senses to apprehend them. And I thought that I had better had recourse to ideas, and seek in them truth in existence. I dare to say that the simile is not perfect--for I am far from admitting that he who contemplates existence through the medium of ideas, sees them only "through a glass darkly," any more than he who sees them in their working and effects.
10/31/1853, 13:40 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
10/31/1853, 13:41 - Socrates: Athenian men, I respect and love you,but I shall obey the god rather than you...
12/10/1782, 17:53 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
12/10/1782, 17:54 - Socrates: True wisdom comes to each of us when we realize how little we understand about life, ourselves, & the world around us.

07/23/1817, 12:23 - Socrates: The hour of departure has arrived, and we go our ways - I to die, and you to live. Which is better only god knows.
02/01/1842, 12:12 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
02/01/1842, 12:13 - Socrates: Is there anyone to whom you entrust a greater number of serious matters than your wife? And is there anyone with whom you have fewer conversations?
03/14/1822, 12:18 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
03/14/1822, 12:19 - Socrates: As for me, all I know is that I know nothing.
04/03/1869, 06:48 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
04/03/1869, 06:49 - Socrates: I pity those reviewers above, and people like them, who ridicule authors like R.A. Boulay and other proponents of similar Ancient Astronaut theories, simply for putting forth so many interesting questions (because that's really what he often throughout openly admits is all he does does) in light of fascinating and thought-provoking references which are all from copious sources.Some people will perhaps only read the cover and introduction and dismiss it as soon as any little bit of information flies in the face of their beliefs or normalcy biases. Some of those people, I'm sure, are some of the ones who reviewed this book so negatively without any constructive criticism or plausible rebuttal. It's sad to see how programmed and indoctrinated the vast majority of humanity has become to the ills of dogma, indoctrination, unverified status quos and basic ignorance; not to mention the laziness and conformity that results in such acquiescence and lack of critical thinking or lack of information gathering to confirm or debunk something. Too many people just take what's spoon fed to them all their lives and settle for it unquestioningly. For those people I like to offer a great Einstein quote and one of my personal favorites and that is:"Condemnation without investigation is the highest form of ignorance"I found this book to be a very interesting gathering of information and collection of obscure and/or remote antiquated information, i.e. biblical, sacred, mythological and otherwise, that we were not exactly taught to us in bible school, or any other public school for that matter. And I am of the school of thought that has been so for intended purposes.The author clearly cites all his fascinating sources and cross-references them rather plausibly. He organizes the information in a sequential manner that piques ones interest even as he jumps from one set of information to the next. The information, although eclectic as it spans from different cultures and time periods, interestingly ties together in several respects and it is this synchronicity that makes the information all the more remarkable.For those of you who continue to seek truth and enlightenment because you understand that an open mind makes for and lifelong pursuit of such things I leave you with these Socrates quotes:"True wisdom comes to each of us when we realize how little we understand about life, ourselves, and the world around us.
08/07/1807, 18:15 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
08/07/1807, 18:16 - Socrates: It is only in death that we are truly cured of the 'sickness' of life.

12/15/1827, 05:36 - Socrates: A Life without criticism and status is not a worth living.
04/11/1786, 05:08 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
04/11/1786, 05:09 - Socrates: We approach truth only inasmuch as we depart from life. For what do we, who love truth, strive after in life? To free ourselves from the body, and from all the evil that is caused by the life of the body! If so, then how can we fail to be glad when death comes to us?The wise man seeks death all his life and therefore death is not terrible to him.
08/18/1800, 06:05 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
08/18/1800, 06:06 - Socrates: I shall never cease from the practice and teaching of philosophy, exhorting anyone whom I meet after my manner, and convincing him, saying: O my friend, why do you who are a citizen of the great and mighty and wise city of Athens, care so much about laying up the greatest amount of money and honor and reputation, and so little about wisdom and truth and the greatest improvement of the soul, which you never regard or heed at all? Are you not ashamed of this?

04/22/1817, 20:29 - Socrates: Would that the majority could inflict the greatest evils, for they would then be capable of the greatest good, and that would be fine, but now they cannot do either. They cannot make a man either wise or foolish, but they inflict things haphazardly.

12/29/1845, 21:41 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
12/29/1845, 21:42 - Socrates: There is one way, then, in which a man can be free from all anxiety about the fate of his soul - if in life he has abandoned bodily pleasures and adornments, as foreign to his purpose and likely to do more harm than good, and has devoted himself to the pleasures of acquiring knowledge, and so by decking his soul not with a borrowed beauty but with its own - with self-control, and goodness, and courage, and liberality, and truth - has fitted himself to await his journey in the next world.

10/20/1826, 21:03 - Socrates: Do you know that the spectator is the last of the rings which, as I am saying, receive the power of the original magnet from one another? The rhapsode like yourself and the actor are intermediate links, and the poet himself is the first of them. Through all these the God sways the souls of men in any direction which he pleases, and makes one man hang down from another. Thus there is a vast chain of dancers and masters and undermasters of choruses, who are suspended, as if from the stone, at the side of the rings which hang down from the Muse. And every poet has some Muse from whom he is suspended, and by whom he is said to be possessed, which is nearly the 	Ion 5same thing; for he is taken hold of.

04/26/1872, 08:52 - Socrates: I was attached to this city by the god—though it seems a ridiculous thing to say—as upon a great and noble horse which was somewhat sluggish because of its size and needed to be stirred up by a kind of gadfly. It is to fulfill some such function that I believe the god has placed me in the city. I never cease to rouse each and every one of you, to persuade and reproach youall day long and everywhere I find myself in your company.

08/20/1782, 14:31 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
08/20/1782, 14:32 - Socrates: I am wiser than this man, for neither of us appears to know anything great and good; but he fancies he knows something, although he knows nothing; whereas I, as I do not know anything, so I do not fancy I do. In this trifling particular, then, I appear to be wiser than he, because I do not fancy I know what I do not know.
07/09/1814, 05:03 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
07/09/1814, 05:04 - Socrates: I'm wiser than that person. For it's likely that neither of us knows anything fine and good, but he thinks he knows something he doesn't know, whereas I, since I don't in fact know, don't think that I do either. At any rate, it seems that I'm wiser than he in just this one small way: that what I don't know, I don't think I know.

02/17/1870, 22:48 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
02/17/1870, 22:49 - Socrates: Is there not one true coin for which all things ought to exchange?- and that is wisdom; and only in exchange for this, and in company with this, is anything truly bought or sold, whether courage, temperance or justice. And is not all true virtue the companion of wisdom, no matter what fears or pleasures or other similar goods or evils may or may not attend her? But the virtue which is made up of these goods, when they are severed from wisdom and exchanged with one another, is a shadow of virtue only, nor is there any freedom or health or truth in her; but in the true exchange there is a purging away of all these things, and temperance, and justice, and courage, and wisdom herself, are a purgation of them.
12/04/1793, 15:12 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
12/04/1793, 15:13 - Socrates: Some of the opinions which people entertain should be respected, and others should not.
03/02/1773, 15:24 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
03/02/1773, 15:25 - Socrates: It is a base thing for a man to wax old in careless self-neglect before he has lifted up his eyes and seen what manner of man he was made to be, in the full perfection of bodily strength and beauty. But these glories are withheld from him who is guilty of self-neglect, for they are not wont to blaze forth unbidden.

09/03/1802, 03:27 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
09/03/1802, 03:28 - Socrates: Suppose... that you acquit me... Suppose that, in view of this, you said to me 'Socrates, on this occasion we shall disregard Anytus and acquit you, but only on one condition, that you give up spending your time on this quest and stop philosophizing. If we catch you going on in the same way, you shall be put to death.' Well, supposing, as I said, that you should offer to acquit me on these terms, I should reply 'Gentlemen, I am your very grateful and devoted servant, but I owe a greater obedience to God than to you; and so long as I draw breath and have my faculties, I shall never stop practicing philosophy and exhorting you and elucidating the truth for everyone that I meet. I shall go on saying, in my usual way, "My very good friend, you are an Athenian and belong to a city which is the greatest and most famous in the world for its wisdom and strength. Are you not ashamed that you give your attention to acquiring as much money as possible, and similarly with reputation and honour, and give no attention or thought to truth and understanding and the perfection of your soul?" And if any of you disputes this and professes to care about these things, I shall not at once let him go or leave him; no, I shall question him and examine him and test him; and if it appears that in spite of his profession he has made no real progress towards goodness, I shall reprove him for neglecting what is of supreme importance, and giving his attention to trivialities. I shall do this to everyone that I meet, young or old, foreigner or fellow-citizen; but especially to you my fellow-citizens, inasmuch as you are closer to me in kinship. This, I do assure you, is what my God commands; and it is my belief that no greater good has ever befallen you in this city than my service to my God; for I spend all my time going about trying to persuade you, young and old, to make your first and chief concern not for your bodies nor for your possessions, but for the highest welfare of your souls, proclaiming as I go 'Wealth does not bring goodness, but goodness brings wealth and every other blessing, both to the individual and to the State.' ...And so, gentlemen, I would say, 'You can please yourselves whether you listen to Anytus or not, and whether you acquit me or not; you know that I am not going to alter my conduct, not even if I have to die a hundred deaths.
12/25/1843, 19:06 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
12/25/1843, 19:07 - Socrates: You are wrong sir, if you think that a man who is any good at all should take into account the risk of life or death; he should look to this only in his actions, whether what he does is right or wrong.
07/05/1831, 03:22 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
07/05/1831, 03:23 - Socrates: Aren't you ashamed to be concerned so much about making all the money you can and advancing your reputation and prestige, while for truth and wisdom and the improvement of your souls you have no thought or car?

07/12/1801, 01:29 - Socrates: Thus such another will not easily come to you, men, but if you believe me, you will spare me; but perhaps you might possibly be offended, like the sleeping who are awakened, striking me, believing Anytus, you might easily kill, then the rest of your lives you might continue sleeping, unless the god caring for you should send you another.
03/11/1799, 11:48 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ

08/11/1860, 12:34 - Socrates: By observing objects with my eyes and trying to comprehend them with each of my other senses I might blind my soul altogether... [like] when [people] watch and study an eclipse of the sun; they really do sometimes injure their eyes, unless they study its reflection in water or some other medium.
09/10/1804, 23:16 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
09/10/1804, 23:17 - Socrates: When death comes to a man, the mortal part of him dies, but the immortal part retires at the approach of death and escapes unharmed and indestructible... [I]t is as certain as anything can be... that soul is immortal and imperishable, and that our souls will really exist in the next world.
08/17/1796, 19:58 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
08/17/1796, 19:59 - Socrates: Real wisdom is the property of God, and... human wisdom has little or no value.

08/24/1836, 00:56 - Socrates: Once a man knows good from evil, nothing on earth can compel him to act against that knowledge.
01/22/1872, 22:25 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
01/22/1872, 22:26 - Socrates: If the soul is immortal, it demands our care not only for that part of time which we call life, but for all time: and indeed it would seem now that it will be extremely dangerous to neglect it. If death were a release from everything, it would be a boon for the wicked. But since the soul is clearly immortal, it can have no escape or security from evil except by becoming as good and wise as it possibly can. For it takes nothing with it to the next world except its education and training: and these, we are told, are of supreme importance in helping or harming the newly dead at the very beginning of his journey there.
07/10/1786, 17:45 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
07/10/1786, 17:46 - Socrates: Madness, provided it comes as the gift of heaven, is the channel by which we receive the greatest blessings....the men of old who gave things their names saw no disgrace or reproach in madness; otherwise they would not have connected it with the name of the noblest of all arts, the art of discerning the future, and called it the manic art....So, according to the evidence provided by our ancestors, madness is a nobler thing than sober sense...madness comes from God, whereas sober sense is merely human.
02/28/1824, 22:08 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
02/28/1824, 22:09 - Socrates: So I withdrew and thought to myself: 'I am wiser than this man; it is likely that neither of us knows anything worthwhile, but he thinks he knows something when he does not, whereas when I do not know, neither do I think I know; so I am likely to be wiser than he to this small extent, that I do not think I know what I do not know.
07/23/1862, 08:53 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
07/23/1862, 08:54 - Socrates: I am likely to be wiser than he to this small, extent, that I do not think I know what I do not know

08/01/1834, 00:21 - Socrates: I am likely to be wiser than he to this small, extent, that I do not think I know what I do not know.
10/08/1870, 13:27 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
10/08/1870, 13:28 - Socrates: Let us reflect in another way, and we shall see that there is great reason to hope that death is a good; for one of two things—either death is a state of nothingness and utter unconsciousness, or, as men say, there is a change and migration of the soul from this world to another. Now if you suppose that there is no consciousness, but a sleep like the sleep of him who is undisturbed even by dreams, death will be an unspeakable gain. For if a person were to select the night in which his sleep was undisturbed even by dreams, and were to compare with this the other days and nights of his life, and then were to tell us how many days and nights he had passed in the course of his life better and more pleasantly than this one, I think that any man, I will not say a private man, but even the great king will not find many such days or nights, when compared with the others. Now if death be of such a nature, I say that to die is gain; for eternity is then only a single night. But if death is the journey to another place, and there, as men say, all the dead abide, what good, O my friends and judges, can be greater than this? If indeed when the pilgrim arrives in the world below, he is delivered from the professors of justice in this world, and finds the true judges who are said to give judgment there, Minos and Rhadamanthus and Aeacus and Triptolemus, and other sons of God who were righteous in their own life, that pilgrimage will be worth making. What would not a man give if he might converse with Orpheus and Musaeus and Hesiod and Homer? Nay, if this be true, let me die again and again.
04/25/1782, 00:24 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ

08/02/1847, 04:11 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
08/02/1847, 04:12 - Socrates: ...If everything that has some share of life were to die, and if after death the dead remained in that form and did not come to life again, would it not be quite inevitable that in the end everything should be dead and nothing alive?... [W]hat possible means could prevent their number from being exhausted by death?
03/09/1861, 03:17 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
03/09/1861, 03:18 - Socrates: I am convinced that I never wrong anyone intentionally...

06/29/1865, 13:49 - Socrates: Rhythm and harmony permeate the innermost element of the soul, affect it more powerfully than anything else, and bring it grace, such education makes one graceful if one is properly trained, and the opposite if one is not.

11/05/1856, 12:48 - Socrates: ...We must not let it enter our minds that there may be no validity in argument. On the contrary we should recognize that we ourselves are still intellectual invalids; but that we must brace ourselves and do our best to become healthy... No greater misfortune could happen to anyone than that of developing a dislike for argument.

10/22/1805, 10:11 - Socrates: If it were said that without such bones and sinews and all the rest of them I should not be able to do what I think is right, it would be true; but to say that it is because of them that I do what I am doing, and not through choice of what is best - although my actions are controlled by Mind - would be a very lax and inaccurate form of expression.
05/31/1797, 06:03 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
05/31/1797, 06:04 - Socrates: Do we say that one must never willingly do wrong, or does it depend upon the circumstances? Is it true, as we have often agreed before, that there is no sense in which wrongdoing is good or honourable? Or have we jettisoned all our former convictions in these last few days? Can you and I at our age, Crito, have spent all these years in serious discussions without realizing that we were no better than a pair of children? Surely the truth is just what we have always said. Whatever the popular view is, and whether the alternative in pleasanter than the present one or even harder to bear, the fact remains that to do wrong is in every sense bad and dishonourable for the person who does it.

09/05/1774, 21:59 - Socrates: For each of them, men, is able, going into each of the cities, to persuade the young-who can associate with whomever of their own citizens they wish to for free-they persuade these young men to leave off their associations with the latter, and to associate with themselves instead, and to give them money and acknowledge gratitude besides.
06/23/1797, 08:11 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
06/23/1797, 08:12 - Socrates: If the soul is immortal, it demands our care not only for that part of time which we call life, but for all time; and indeed it would seem now that it will be extremely dangerous to neglect it. If death were a release from everything, it would be a boon for the wicked, because by dying they would be released not only from the body but also from their own wickedness together with the soul; but as it is, since the soul is clearly immortal, it can have no escape of security from evil except by becoming as good and wise as it possibly can. For it takes nothing with it to the next world except its education and training...
08/02/1806, 08:36 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
08/02/1806, 08:37 - Socrates: ...You know very well the truth of what I [say]... I have incurred a great deal of bitter hostility; and this is what will bring about my destruction, if anything does... the slander and jealousy of a very large section of the people. They have been fatal to a great many other innocent men, and I suppose will continue to be so; there is no likelihood that they will stop at me. But perhaps someone will say 'Do you feel no compunction, Socrates, at having followed a line of action which puts you in danger of the death-penalty?' I might fairly reply to him 'You are mistaken, my friend, if you think that a man who is worth anything ought to spend his time weighing up the prospects of life and death. He has only one thing to consider in performing any action; that is, whether he is acting rightly or wrongly, like a good man or a bad one...['] The truth of the matter is this, gentlemen. Where a man has once taken up his stand, either because it seems best to him or in obedience to his orders, there I believe he is bound to remain and face the danger, taking no account of death or anything else before dishonour.
10/04/1869, 15:54 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
10/04/1869, 15:55 - Socrates: But my dear Crito, why should we care so much about what the majority think?
08/23/1810, 17:03 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
08/23/1810, 17:04 - Socrates: I know one thing, that I know nothing.
10/13/1779, 21:44 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
10/13/1779, 21:45 - Socrates: You are mistaken, my friend, if you think that a man who is worth anything ought to spend his time weighing up the prospects of life and death. He has only one thing to consider in performing any action; that is, whether he is acting justly or unjustly, like a good man or a bad one.
03/10/1815, 01:45 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
03/10/1815, 01:46 - Socrates: Justice. If only we knew what it was.

07/27/1789, 10:44 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
07/27/1789, 10:45 - Socrates: When I leave this court I shall go away condemned by you to death, but they will go away convicted by Truth herself of depravity and wickedness. And they accept their sentence even as I accept mine...I tell you, my executioners, that as soon as I am dead, vengeance shall fall upon you with a punishment far more painful than your killing of me. You have brought about my death in the belief that through it you will be delivered from submitting your conduct to criticism; but I say that the result will be just the opposite. You will have more critics... If you expect to stop denunciation of your wrong way of life by putting people to death, there is something amiss with your reasoning.This way of escape is neither possible nor creditable; the best and easiest way is not to stop the mouths of others, but to make yourselves as good men as you can. This is my last message to you who voted for my condemnation.
04/18/1784, 02:30 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
04/18/1784, 02:31 - Socrates: Virtue is not given by money, but that from virtue comes money and every other good of man, public as well as private.
06/17/1859, 12:44 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
06/17/1859, 12:45 - Socrates: Anyone who’s really fighting for justice must live as a private citizen and not as a public figure if he’s going to survive even a short time.
09/23/1850, 14:09 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
09/23/1850, 14:10 - Socrates: By all means marry,if you get a good wife, you'll be happy. If you get a bad one, you'll become a philosopher".
09/19/1832, 13:44 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
09/19/1832, 13:45 - Socrates: God only is wise.
06/01/1834, 16:37 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
06/01/1834, 16:38 - Socrates: ...I do not believe that the law of God permits a better man to be harmed by a worse. No doubt my accuser might put me to death or have me banished or deprived of civic rights; but even if he thinks, as he probably does (and others to, I dare say), that these are great calamities, I do not think so... For let me tell you, gentlemen, that to be afraid of death is only another form of thinking that one is wise when one is not; it is to think that one knows what one does not know. No one knows with regard to death whether it is not really the greatest blessing that can happen to a man; but people dread it as though they were certain that it is the greatest evil; and this ignorance, which thinks that it knows what it does not, must surely be ignorance most culpable. This, I take it, gentlemen, is the degree, and this is the nature of my advantage over the rest of mankind; and if I were to claim to be wiser than my neighbour in any respect, it would be in this: that not possessing any real knowledge of what comes after death, I am also conscious that I do not possess it. But I do know that to do wrong and to disobey my superior, whether God or man, is wicked and dishonourable; and so I shall never feel more fear or aversion for something which, for all I know, may really be a blessing, than for those evils which I know to be evils.
05/12/1785, 03:58 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
05/12/1785, 03:59 - Socrates: I only know one thing, and that is I know nothing
10/24/1867, 02:-1 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
10/24/1867, 02:00 - Socrates: ...I do not think that it is right for a man to appeal to the jury or to get himself acquitted by doing so; he ought to inform them of the facts and convince them by argument. The jury does not sit to dispense justice as a favour, but to decide where justice lies; and the oath which they have sworn is not to show favour at their own discretion, but to return a just and lawful verdict... Therefore you must not expect me, gentlemen, to behave towards you in a way which I consider neither reputable nor moral nor consistent with my religious duty.
09/12/1819, 23:46 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
09/12/1819, 23:47 - Socrates: These people... are my dangerous accusers; because those who hear them suppose that anyone who inquires into such matters... theories about the heavens... and everything below the earth... must be an atheist.
01/09/1784, 12:20 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
01/09/1784, 12:21 - Socrates: Bad people live that they may eat and drink, whereas good people eat and drink that they may live.

06/19/1795, 22:05 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
06/19/1795, 22:06 - Socrates: In any inquiry you are likely to attain more nearly to knowledge of your object in proportion to the care and accuracy with which you have prepared yourself to understand that object in itself[.]
09/26/1796, 02:13 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
09/26/1796, 02:14 - Socrates: I went to interview a man with a high reputation for wisdom, because I felt that here if anywhere I should succeed in disproving the oracle and pointing out to my divine authority 'You said that I was the wisest of men, but here is a man who is wiser than I am.' Well, I gave a thorough examination to this person... and in conversation with him I formed the impression that although in many people's opinion, and especially in his own, he appeared to be wise, in fact he was not. Then when I began to try to show him that he only thought he was wise and was not really so, my efforts were resented both by him and by many of the other people present. However, I reflected as I walked away: 'Well, I am certainly wiser than this man. It is only too likely that neither of us has any knowledge to boast of; but he thinks that he knows something which he does not know, whereas I am quite conscious of my ignorance. At any rate it seems that I am wiser than he is to this small extent, that I do not think that I know what I do not know... [A]s I pursued my investigation at the god's command,... my honest impression was... that the people with the greatest reputations were almost entirely deficient, while others who were supposed to be their inferiors were much better qualified in practical intelligence.
11/08/1776, 02:28 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
11/08/1776, 02:29 - Socrates: If at the time of its release the soul is tainted and impure, because it has always associated with the body and cared for it and loved it, and has been so beguiled by the body and its passions and pleasures that nothing seems real to it but those physical things which can be touched and seen and eaten and drunk and used for sexual enjoyment; and if it is accustomed to hate and fear and avoid what is invisible and hidden from our eyes, but intelligible and comprehensible by philosophy - if the soul is in this state, do you think that it will escape independent and uncontaminated?
06/18/1861, 23:51 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
06/18/1861, 23:52 - Socrates: Those who care about their souls and do not subordinate them to the body dissociate themselves firmly from these others and refuse to accompany them on their haphazard journey; and, believing that it is wrong to oppose philosophy with her offer of liberation and purification, they turn and follow her wherever she leads...
04/04/1849, 09:-1 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
04/04/1849, 09:00 - Socrates: Perhaps someone may say 'But surely, Socrates, after you have left us you can spend the rest of your life in quietly minding your own business.' This is the hardest thing of all to make some of you understand. If I say that this would be disobedience to God, and that is why I cannot 'mind my own business', you will not believe that I am serious. If on the other hand I tell you that to let no day pass without discussing goodness and all the other subjects about which you hear me talking and examining both myself and others is really the best thing that a man can do, and that life without this sort of examination is not worth living, you will be even less inclined to believe me. Nevertheless, that is how it is, gentlemen, as I maintain; though it is not easy to convince you of it.
05/10/1845, 11:45 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
05/10/1845, 11:46 - Socrates: Man must rise above the Earth—to the top of the atmosphere and beyond—for only thus will he fully understand the world in which he lives.
07/25/1799, 09:43 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
07/25/1799, 09:44 - Socrates: No man on earth who conscientiously opposes either you or any other organized democracy, and flatly prevents a great many wrongs and illegalities from taking place in the state to which he belongs, can possibly escape with his life. The true champion of justice, if he intends to survive even for a short time, must necessarily confine himself to private life and leave politics alone.
05/17/1797, 10:08 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
05/17/1797, 10:09 - Socrates: I know nothing except the fact of my ignorance
04/26/1833, 09:30 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
04/26/1833, 09:31 - Socrates: Someone might say: " Are you not ashamed, Socrates, to have followed the kind of occupation that has led to your being now in danger of death?" Howeverm, I should be right to reply to him: "You are wrong, sir, if you think that a man who is any good at all should take into account the risk of life or death; he should look to this only in his actions, whether what he does is right or wrong, whether he is acting like a good or bad man
06/29/1780, 11:12 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
06/29/1780, 11:13 - Socrates: You have often heard me speak of an oracle or sign which comes to me, and is the divinity which Meletus ridicules in the indictment. This sign I have had ever since I was a child. The sign is a voice which comes to me and always forbids me to do something which I am going to do...
06/17/1870, 01:31 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
06/17/1870, 01:32 - Socrates: Nothing that other people can do to you can harm you enough to cancel out the benefit you bestow on yourself by acting rightly. It follows that bad people ultimately harm only themselves: nothing can harm a good man either in life or after death
01/19/1867, 12:56 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
01/19/1867, 12:57 - Socrates: For I go around doing nothing but persuading both young and old among you not to care for your body or your wealth in preference to or as strongly as for the best possible state of your soul, as I say to you: Wealth does no bring about excellence, but excellence makes wealth and everything else good for men, both individually and collectively
04/12/1860, 11:05 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
04/12/1860, 11:06 - Socrates: ...I have had a remarkable experience. In the past the prophetic voice to which I have become accustomed has always been my constant companion, opposing me even in quite trivial things if I was going to take the wrong course. Now something has happened to me, as you can see, which might be thought and is commonly considered to be a supreme calamity; yet neither when I left home this morning, nor when I was taking my place here in court, nor at any point in any part of my speech did the divine sign oppose me. In other discussions it has often checked me in the middle of a sentence; but this time it has never opposed me in any part of this business in anything that I have said or done. What do I suppose to be the explanation? I will tell you. I suspect that this thing that has happened to me is a blessing, and we are quite mistaken in supposing death to be an evil. I have good grounds for thinking this, because my accustomed sign could not have failed to oppose me if what I was doing had not been sure to bring some good result.
09/06/1863, 12:48 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
09/06/1863, 12:49 - Socrates: It looks as if I was cleverer than Daedalus in using my skill, my friend, insofar as he could only cause to move the things he made himself, but I can make other people’s move as well as my own. And the smartest part of my skill is that I am clever without wanting to be, for I would rather have your statements to me remain unmoved than possess the wealth of Tantalus as well as the cleverness of Daedalus

10/15/1786, 01:01 - Socrates: My method is to call in support of my statements the evidence of a single witness, the man I am arguing with, and to take his vote alone; the rest of the world are nothing to me; I am not talking to them.

08/13/1820, 12:26 - Socrates: Why do you wonder that globetrotting does not help you, seeing that you always take yourself with you? The reason that set you wandering is ever at your heels.

10/18/1823, 20:42 - Socrates: Do it because it's in your heart. Not because you want something in return.

09/10/1797, 12:11 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
09/10/1797, 12:12 - Socrates: Man, you don’t speak well, if you believe that a man worth anything at all would give countervailing weight to the danger of life or death, or give consideration to anything but this when he acts: whether his action is just or unjust, the action of a good or of an evil man.
10/02/1812, 04:15 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
10/02/1812, 04:16 - Socrates: So I spoke the truth when I said that neither I nor you nor any other man would rather do injustice than suffer it: for it is worse.
01/16/1865, 19:05 - Plato: XXXYYYZZZ
01/16/1865, 19:06 - Socrates: Then if it is impossible both for things unlike to be like and for like things to be unlike, then it’s also impossible for there to be many things? For if there were many things, they would incur impossibilities.

12/09/1846, 19:41 - Socrates: Surely this is the objectionable kind of ignorance, to think one knowswhat one does not know? But in this, gentlemen, here also perhaps Iam different from the general run of mankind, and if I should claimto be wiser than someone in something it would be in this, that as Ido not know well enough about what happens in the house of Hades,so I do not think I know.

05/12/1826, 14:45 - Socrates: we should not become misologues, as people become misan- dthropes. There is no greater evil one can suffer than to hate reasonablediscourse. Misology and misanthropy arise in the same way. Misanthropy comes when a man without knowledge or skill has placed greattrust in someone and believes him to be altogether truthful, sound, andtrustworthy; then, a short time afterwards he finds him to be wickedand unreliable, and then this happens in another case; when one hasfrequently had that experience, especially with those whom one believed eto be one’s closest friends, then, in the end, after many such blows,one comes to hate all men and to believe that no one is sound in anyway at all.
